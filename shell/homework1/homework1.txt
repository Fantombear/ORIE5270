Data: First 7 trade files

1)Get the first 5000 lines of each of those files in new files.
2)Apply the edit modifications to those smaller files, and add a new column with the date of the file. 3_Add the modified files in Github
Explain the following code: filename='test_taqtrade20141201'sed  '1 d' $filename | sed 's/[^[:alnum:]]\+$//;s/ \{1,\}/,/g' | sed 's/,/-/2g' | sed '1i A,B' | sed $'s/\r$//' | sed '/^$/d' > test_data.txt

My explaination:
filename='test_taqtrade20141201' : define a variable refer to the string 'test_taqtrade20141201'
sed  '1 d' $filename : delete the first line in file $filename
sed 's/[^[:alnum:]]\+$//;s/ \{1,\}/,/g' : 
	The first part 's/[^[:alnum:]]\+$//' is to delete those none digits or characters at the end of each line. "\+" means one or more mathches.
	The second part 's/ \{1,\}/,/g' is to substitute one or more space into comma in each line. g means globally substitue.
sed 's/,/-/2g' : substitue from the second comma  into '-' globally in each line
sed '1i A,B' : insert A,B in the first line
sed $'s/\r$//': delete \r at the end
sed '/^$/d' : delete the empty lines.
> test_data.txt : output the text after those sed commends into file test_data.txt
